Telugu cinema, also known as Tollywood, is the segment of Indian cinema dedicated to the production of motion pictures in the Telugu language, widely spoken in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Telugu cinema is based in Film Nagar, Hyderabad. As of 2021, Telugu cinema is the largest film industry in India in terms of box-office.[5][6] Telugu films sold 23.3 crore (233 million) tickets in 2022, the highest among various film industries in India.[3][4]

Technical crafts of Telugu cinema, especially visual effects and cinematography, are considered as one of the most advanced in Indian cinema.[7] The industry has produced some of India's most expensive and highest-grossing films of all time. Telugu production Baahubali 2 (2017) is currently the highest-grossing film of all time in India. The Telugu film industry is home to Ramoji Film City, certified by the Guinness World Records as the largest film studio complex in the world measuring over 1,666 acres (674 ha).[8][9]

Since 1909, filmmaker Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu was involved in producing short films and exhibiting them in different regions of Asia. He established the first Indian-owned cinema halls in South India.[10] In 1921, he produced the silent film, Bhishma Pratigna, generally considered to be the first Telugu feature film.[17] As the first Telugu film exhibitor and producer, Naidu is regarded as the 'Father of Telugu cinema'.[18] The first Telugu film with audible dialogue, Bhakta Prahlada (1932) was directed by H. M. Reddy. In 1933, Sati Savitri directed by C. Pullayya received an honorary diploma at the 2nd Venice Film Festival.[19] Since its inception, Telugu cinema was known as the pre-eminent centre of Hindu mythological films in India.[20] From the late 1930s, films focused on contemporary living and social issues, like Raithu Bidda (1939), were produced and gradually gained prominence.

Ten Telugu films were featured in CNN-IBN's list of "100 Greatest Indian Films of All Time".[note 1] Though known for big-ticket, and masala films catering to wider audience, Telugu filmmakers have also forayed into parallel and arthouse films.[22] Parallel films like Daasi (1988), Thilaadanam (2000), Vanaja (2006) among others have won accolades at major film festivals including Berlin, Karlovy Vary, Moscow, and Busan.[note 2]

Since the mid-2010s, Telugu cinema has pioneered the pan-Indian film movement, cutting across ethnic and linguistic barriers. Baahubali 2 (2017) won the Saturn Award for Best International Film. RRR (2022) is only the second non-English language film ever to make it to the National Board of Review's Top Ten Films. It received various international accolades including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for the song "Naatu Naatu" and the Critics' Choice Award for Best Foreign Language Film. RRR is the first Indian film by an Indian production to win an Academy Award.[30]

Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu was a photographer and photographic studio owner in Madras who was drawn into filmmaking. Since 1909, he was involved in producing short films.[34][35] He shot 12 three-minute-long short films and exhibited them in Victoria Public Hall, Madras. He also travelled to Bangalore, Vijayawada, Sri Lanka, Rangoon and Pegu to exhibit his films.[34] In c. 1909-10, he established a tent house called Esplanade in Madras to exhibit his films.[18][33] In c. 1912-14, he established Gaiety Theatre on Mount Road, the first ever permanent cinema theatre in Madras and all of South India.[18][36] He later constructed Crown Theatre on Mint Street and Globe Theatre in Purasawakkam.[33][34] In his theatres, he screened American and European films as well as silent films made in various parts of India.[10]

In 1919, he started a film production company called 'Star of East Films' also called 'Glass Studio', the first production company established by a Telugu person.[36][33] He sent his son, Raghupati Surya Prakash Naidu (R. S. Prakash) to study filmmaking in the studios of England, Germany, and United States.[10] In 1921, they made Bhishma Pratigna, generally considered as the first Telugu feature film.[17] Venkaiah Naidu produced the film, while R. S. Prakash directed and produced it along with playing the title character Bhishma.[36] As the first Telugu film exhibitor and producer, Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu is regarded as the 'Father of Telugu cinema'.[18]

From 1921 to 1931 about a dozen feature films were made by Telugu people.[37] C. Pullayya made a three-reel short film, Markandeya (1926 or 1931) at his house in Kakinada.[38][37] In 1921, the first cinema hall in Andhra, Maruthi Cinema was established in Vijayawada by Pothina Srinivasa Rao.[18] Y. V. Rao and R. S. Prakash established a long-lasting precedence of focusing exclusively on religious themes —Gajendra Moksham, Nandanar, and Matsyavataram —three of their most noted productions, centred on religious figures, parables, and morals.

Rise of the "talkie"

The first Telugu film with audible dialogue, Bhakta Prahlada, was directed by H. M. Reddy, who directed the first bilingual (Tamil and Telugu) talkie Kalidas (1931). Bhakta Prahlada was shot over 18 or 20 days at Imperial Studios, Bombay and was produced by Ardeshir Irani who also produced Alam Ara, India's first sound film.[40] The film had an all-Telugu starcast featuring Sindhoori Krishna Rao as the titular Prahlada, Munipalle Subbayya as Hiranyakasyapa, and Surabhi Kamalabai as Leelavathy.[35] Bhakta Prahlada was completed on 15 September 1931,[41] which henceforth became known as "Telugu Film Day" to commemorate its completion.[42][43][44]

Popularly known as talkies, films with sound quickly grew in number and popularity. In 1932, Sagar Movietone produced Rama Paduka Pattabhishekam and Sakunthala, both directed by Sarvottam Badami.[45] Neither the producer nor the director of these two films were Telugus. In 1933, Pruthviputra, based on the story of Narakasura was released.[46] It starred Kalyanam Raghuramayya and was produced by Pothina Srinivasa Rao, who had previously built the first cinema hall in Andhra in 1921. This was the first Telugu talkie entirely financed by Telugu people.[46]

In 1934, the industry saw its first major commercial success with Lava Kusa. Directed by C. Pullayya and starring Parupalli Subbarao and Sriranjani, the film attracted unprecedented numbers of viewers to theatres and thrust the young industry into mainstream culture.[35][46] Dasari Kotiratnam produced Anasuya in 1935 and became the first female producer of Telugu film industry.[47] The first film studio in Andhra, Durga Cinetone, was built in 1936 by Nidamarthi Surayya in Rajahmundry.[48][49] Sampurna Ramayanam (1936) was the first film produced by the studio relying mostly on local talent.[48] In 1937, another studio called Andhra Cinetone was built in Visakhapatnam.[50][10] However, both the studios were short-lived.

By 1936, the mass appeal of film allowed directors to move away from religious and mythological themes.[35] That year, under the direction of Kruthiventi Nageswara Rao, Prema Vijayam, a film with a contemporary setting, was released. It was the first Telugu film with a modern-day setting as opposed to mythological and folklore films.[51] Later, more 'social films' i.e. films based on contemporary life and social issues, were made by filmmakers. Notable among them was Vandemataram (1939), touching on societal problems like the practice of dowry. Telugu films increasingly focused on contemporary living: 29 of the 96 films released between 1937 and 1947 had social themes.[52]

In 1938, Gudavalli Ramabrahmam has co-produced and directed the social problem film, Mala Pilla starring Kanchanamala. The film dealt with the crusade against untouchability, prevailing in pre-independent India.[55][56] In 1939, he directed Raithu Bidda, starring thespian Bellary Raghava. The film was banned by the British administration in the region, for depicting the uprise of the peasantry among the Zamindar's during the British raj.[57] The success of these films gave an impetus to Y. V. Rao, B. N. Reddy and others to produce films on social themes.[35] Viswa Mohini (1940) is the first Indian film depicting the Indian movie world. The film was directed by Y. V. Rao and scripted by Balijepalli Lakshmikantha Kavi, starring V. Nagayya. Rao subsequently made the sequel films Savithri and Sathyabhama (1941–42) casting thespian Sthanam Narasimha Rao.[58][59]

The outbreak of World War II and the subsequent resource scarcity caused the British Raj to impose a limit on the use of filmstrip in 1943 to 11,000 feet,[60] a sharp reduction from the 20,000 feet that had been common till then.[61] As a result, the number of films produced during the war was substantially lower than in previous years. Nonetheless, before the ban, an important shift occurred in the industry: Independent studios formed, actors and actresses were signed to contracts limiting whom they could work for, and films moved from social themes to folklore legends.[62] Ghantasala Balaramayya, has directed the mythological Sri Seeta Rama Jananam (1944) under his home production, Prathiba Picture, marking veteran Akkineni Nageswara Rao's debut in a lead role.[63]

Classical cinema and Golden Age
Malliswari is the first Telugu film which had a public release with thirteen prints along with Chinese subtitles at Beijing on 14 March 1953, and a 16 mm film print was also screened in the United States.[64][65] The film was directed by B. N. Reddy, a recipient of the Dada Saheb Phalke Award, and the Doctor of Letters honour.[65]

The industry is one of the largest producers of folklore, fantasy, and mythological films.[66][67][68] Filmmakers like K. V. Reddy, B. Vittalacharya and Kodi Ramakrishna have pioneered this genre.[69][70] 1956 film Tenali Ramakrishna has garnered the All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film.

K. V. Reddy's Mayabazar (1957) is a landmark film in Indian cinema, a classic of Telugu cinema that inspired generations of filmmakers. It blends myth, fantasy, romance and humour in a timeless story, captivating audiences with its fantastical elements. The film excelled in various departments like cast performances, production design, music, cinematography and is particularly revered for its use of technology. The use of special effects, innovative for the 1950s, like the first illusion of moonlight, showcased technical brilliance.. Powerful performances and relatable themes ensure Mayabazar stays relevant, a classic enjoyed by new generations. On the centenary of Indian cinema in 2013, CNN-IBN included Mayabazar in its list of "100 greatest Indian films of all time". In a poll conducted by CNN-IBN among those 100 films, Mayabazar was voted by the public as the "greatest Indian film of all time."

Relangi and Ramana Reddy were a comedy double act during this era.[71] Nartanasala (1963) won three awards at the third Afro-Asian Film Festival in Jakarta.[72] Donga Ramudu directed by K. V. Reddy was archived in the curriculum of the Film and Television Institute of India.[73] Nammina Bantu received critical reception at the San Sebastián International Film Festival.[74][75] 1967 film Ummadi Kutumbam was selected by Film Federation of India as one of its entries to the Moscow Film Festival.[73][76] The 1968 cult classic Sudigundalu was screened at the Tashkent and Moscow Film Festivals.[77] Bapu's directorial venture Sakshi was showcased at Tashkent International film festival in 1968.[78] In 1976, he directed Sita Kalyanam got critical acclaim at the BFI London Film Festival and Chicago International Film Festival, and is part of the curriculum at British Film Institute.[79][80]

Rise of Tollywood
The nickname Tollywood is a portmanteau of the words Telugu and Hollywood.[81] Moola Narayana Swamy and B. N. Reddy founded Vijaya Vauhini Studios in 1948 in the city of Chennai.[82] Indian film doyen L. V. Prasad, who started his film career with Bhakta Prahlada, founded Prasad Studios in 1956 based in Chennai.[83] However, through the efforts of D. V. S. Raju, the Telugu film industry completely shifted its base from Chennai to Hyderabad in the early 1990s, during N. T. Rama Rao's political reign.[84]

Veteran actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao relocated to Hyderabad and has developed Annapurna Studios. The Telugu film industry is one of the three largest film producers in India. About 245 Telugu films were produced in 2006, the highest in India for that year. Film studios in Hyderabad, including Ramoji Film City, developed by D. Ramanaidu and Ramoji Rao, are involved in prolific film production and employment.[85] There is a fair amount of dispersion among the Indian film industries. Since 2005, many successful Telugu films have been largely remade by the Bengali cinema and Hindi film industries, while in the past, Telugu filmmakers drew inspiration from Bengali cinema and literature.[86] Telugu film production accounts for one per cent of the gross domestic product of the region.[87][88][89]

The digital cinema network company UFO Moviez marketed by Southern Digital Screenz (SDS) has digitised several cinemas in the region.[90][91] The Film and Television Institute of Telangana, Film and Television Institute of Andhra Pradesh, Ramanaidu Film School and Annapurna International School of Film and Media are some of the largest film schools in India.[92][93] The Telugu states consist of approximately 2800 theatres, the largest number of cinema halls of any state in India.[94] Being commercially consistent, Telugu cinema had its influence over commercial cinema in India.[95]

The industry holds the Guinness World Record for the largest film production facility in the world, Ramoji Film City.[96] The Prasads IMAX located in Hyderabad is one of the largest 3D IMAX screens, and the most attended cinema screen in the world.[97][98][99] As per the CBFC report of 2014, the industry is placed first in India, in terms of films produced yearly.[100] The industry holds a memorandum of understanding with the Motion Picture Association of America to combat video piracy.[101][102][103] In the years 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2014 the industry has produced the largest number of films in India, exceeding the number of films produced in Bollywood.[104][85]

1992 film Gharana Mogudu is the first Telugu film to gross over ₹10 crore at the box office.[105] Produced on a shoe string budget of ₹1.2 crore, 2000 film Nuvve Kavali became sleeper hit of the late 1990s.[106][107] It was screened for 200 days in 20 screens grossing over ₹20 crore.[108][109][110]

Neo Tollywood

Raghavendra Rao explored devotional themes with Agni Putrudu (1987), Annamayya (1997), Sri Ramadasu (2006), Shirdi Sai (2012) and Om Namo Venkatesaya (2017) receiving various state honours.[114]

Singeetam Srinivasa Rao introduced science fiction to the Telugu screen with Aditya 369 (1991), the film dealt with exploratory dystopian and apocalyptic themes.[115] The edge of the seat thriller had characters which stayed human, inconsistent and insecure. The film's narrative takes the audience into the post apocalyptic experience through time travel, as well as folklore generation of 1500 CE, which including a romantic backstory, the "Time Machine" made it a brilliant work of fiction.[116][117][118]

Jandhyala popularly known as "Hasya Brahma" (Brahma of comedy),[119] ushered a new era of comedy in Telugu cinema, where his movies captivated audiences with their blend of humor and social commentary. "Before his movies, comedy was a small part of movies and comedians were sidekicks to the hero or villain. Jandhyala proved that comedy can itself be a full-length subject and achieved a great success in this endeavor." His films are well known as clean entertainers affable to the family audiences without any obscene language or double entendre.[120]

Ram Gopal Varma's Siva, which attained cult status in Telugu cinema, is one of the first Telugu films produced after the migration of Telugu film industry from Madras to Hyderabad to feature characters speaking the Telangana dialect.[121][122] Varma was credited with the introduction of steadicams and new sound recording techniques in Telugu films.[123] Within a year of the film's release, more than ten steadicams were imported into India.[124] Siva attracted the young audience during its theatrical run, and its success encouraged filmmakers to explore a variety of themes and make experimental Telugu films.[125][126]

Subsequently, Varma introduced road movie and film-noir to Indian screen with Kshana Kshanam. Varma experimented with close-to-life performances by the lead actors, which bought a rather fictional storyline a sense of authenticity at a time when the industry was being filled with unnecessary commercial fillers.[127] It went on to gather a cult following in south India,[128] with a dubbed Hindi version titled Hairaan released to positive reports from bollywood critics, the Ann Arbor Film Festival, and the Fribourg Festival.[129][130]

The film re-introduced social realism to Telugu screen, and brought back its lost glory which until then was stuck in its run of the mill commercial pot-boilers.[133]

Vanaja (2006) won several international awards including the first prize in the live-action feature film category at the Chicago International Children's Film Festival.[134] Dream (2012), has garnered the Royal Reel Award at the Canada International Film Festival.[135][136][137] 2013 Social problem film, Naa Bangaaru Talli won Best Film award at the Detroit Trinity International Film Festival.[138][139][140]

During the 1990s, the Rayalaseema dialect was portrayed in films about the factional conflicts in the area, while the Telangana dialect, already having been pegged to villainous and comedic roles, saw an increase in this usage in reaction to the shift of the Telugu film production from Madras to Hyderabad.[144][145] After the formation of the state of Telangana in 2014, Telangana culture gained more prominence, and more films were produced portraying Telangana culture, and dialect.[146]
